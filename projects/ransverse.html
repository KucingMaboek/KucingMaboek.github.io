    <h2>Ransverse</h2>
    <div class="project-description-header">
      <img src="../img/projects/ransverse/icon.png" class="project-icon">
      <p>Ransverse is an open-world NFT-based game developed by RANS Entertainment in collaboration with Shinta VR as the
        development partner. As the lead programmer on this project, I was responsible for creating the core systems
        that drive the game. In addition to programming, I guided my team in building and optimizing various features to
        ensure a smooth and engaging experience for players. The game is available across desktop, mobile, and VR
        platforms, allowing users to access the world of Ransverse on multiple devices.</p>
    </div>
    <p>One of the unique features of Ransverse is the integration of crypto wallet authentication via MetaMask, enabling
      users to connect their wallet and interact with the game seamlessly. The development is divided into two main
      components: the Experience and the Launcher. The Experience is the main application where the open-world gameplay
      unfolds, while the Launcher is a separate application for checking and updating the desktop version of the
      Experience.</p>
    <h2>Key Features and My Contributions</h2>
    <h3>Avatar Editor</h3>
    <p>This feature allows players to customize their avatars, In Ransverse, players can personalize various aspects of
      their avatar, including gender, head shape, skin tone, hairstyle, hair color, clothing, and accessories.</p>

    <h3>Additive Scene Management</h3>
    <p>Since Ransverse is an open-world game, efficient memory management is crucial for performance. To optimize the
      game, I implemented an additive scene loading system. This system only loads the scene where the player is
      currently located and the surrounding areas in their line of sight. By loading only necessary assets, we reduce
      memory usage and ensure smoother gameplay.</p>

    </div>
    <h3>Launcher and Updater</h3>
    <p>The Launcher for the desktop version includes a built-in updater, allowing users to patch the game without having
      to download the entire application again. Initially, I developed the launcher using .NET and WPF for the GUI, but
      I later rebuilt it in Unity for increased flexibility.</p>
    <img src="../img/projects/ransverse/3.jpg" class="project-screenshot">
    <p>Unity posed a challenge in creating a window without borders, which is a native feature in .NET. To achieve this
      in Unity, I used a Windows API library to manipulate the window borders, essentially creating a full-screen
      application with a transparent background. The updater system allows users to download only patches rather than
      reinstalling the entire game, making the update process more efficient.</p>

    <img src="../img/projects/ransverse/5.jpg" class="project-screenshot">
    <h3>Desktop Installer</h3>
    <p>To enhance the professionalism of the desktop version, I created an installer using Inno Setup. Instead of
      downloading a *.zip file, users can now install Ransverse with a customized *.exe file, making the
      installation process smoother and more user-friendly. I configured the installer to automatically request
      administrative privileges if the application is installed on the C drive, which prevents issues with the updater
      being blocked by administrator permissions. This approach provides a streamlined installation experience,
      improving the game's accessibility and user experience.</p>
