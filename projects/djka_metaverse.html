    <h2>DJKA Metaverse</h2>
    <div class="project-description-header">
      <img src="../img/projects/djka_metaverse/icon.png" class="project-icon">
      <p>DJKA Metaverse is an innovative game designed to simulate the inspection and maintenance of railway
        locomotives.
        Developed by DITJEN PERKERETAAPIAN in collaboration with Shinta VR, this project aims to provide a realistic
        training environment for railway personnel. I have the privilege of contributing to this project as the lead
        programmer, where I am responsible for creating the core gameplay elements, including the multiplayer system, VR
        interaction, and multiplatform functionality. In my role, I also guide my team in implementing various systems
        within the game.</p>
    </div>
    <p>The game features three distinct roles: the Committee, Assessor, and Participant. The Committee and Assessor can
      be played on desktop platforms, while the Participants engage in the VR experience. The Committee's primary
      responsibility is to host rooms for the Assessors and Participants, ensuring a smooth flow of the simulation. The
      Assessors can create maintenance or inspection simulations and evaluate the Participantsâ€™ performance.
      Participants are able to interact with each simulated object, with changes made to these objects synchronizing in
      real-time with both the Assessor and Committee.</p>
    <h2>Key Responsibilities and Challenges</h2>
    <p>In my role as lead programmer, I faced several key challenges while developing DJKA Metaverse:</p>
    <h3>Optimization</h3>
    <p>One of the significant challenges was addressing the high memory usage, which resulted in low frame rates,
      especially on the VR platform. To tackle this issue, I implemented several optimization techniques such as texture
      crunching and creating Level of Detail (LOD) models. I customized existing 3D assets in Blender to create
      efficient LOD versions, which significantly improved performance and frame rates during gameplay.</p>

    <h3>Multiplayer</h3>
    <p>Synchronization issues commonly arise in multiplayer environments, affecting the gameplay experience. I focused
      on developing robust networking solutions to ensure that all players remained in sync during simulations. While
      these challenges were complex, we were able to implement effective solutions that maintained the integrity of the
      multiplayer experience.</p>

    <h3>VR Interaction</h3>
    <p>Bugs frequently occurred in the VR interactions, particularly regarding synchronization with other platforms.
      Additionally, some interactions did not meet our expectations in terms of responsiveness. To address these
      challenges, I worked on refining the interaction mechanics and testing extensively to ensure a smooth and
      immersive experience for users.</p>

    </div>
    <h3>Multiplatform Compatibility</h3>
    <p>Ensuring a seamless experience across different devices presented its own set of challenges. For VR users,
      symptoms such as dizziness or nausea were common due to the immersive nature of the device. To mitigate these
      issues, I implemented a locomotion system that allows users to choose between walking and teleportation.
      Additionally, I introduced a vignette feature for the walking option to reduce motion sickness and improve comfort
      during gameplay.</p>
