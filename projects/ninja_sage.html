      <p>Ninja Sage is a private server of Ninja Saga that has been extensively customized to enhance the gaming
        experience for players. I have been actively contributing to the development of a remake of Ninja Sage using the
        Unity engine, which allows for improved graphics, mechanics, and overall gameplay.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Currently, my focus is on implementing the exam features, which are crucial for player progression within the
      game. Some of the exam features I have worked on include the Free Roam System, Writing Exam, Hand Seal Exam, and
      Kekkai Exam.</p>
    <h3>Free Roam System</h3>
    <p>The Free Roam System enables players to freely explore the game world using a point-and-click interface. This
      feature allows for greater immersion and interaction with the environment, giving players the freedom to navigate
      through different areas of the map at their own pace.</p>

    </div>
    <h3>Writing Exam</h3>
    <p>The Writing Exam consists of multiple-choice questions that test playersâ€™ knowledge of various aspects of the
      game, from lore to gameplay mechanics. This feature encourages players to engage more deeply with the game's
      content and understand the world of ninjas.</p>

    <h3>Hand Seal Exam</h3>
    <p>The Hand Seal Exam challenges players to memorize specific hand seal patterns, which are essential for executing
      powerful jutsu. This feature adds a layer of skill-based gameplay, as players must pay close attention to the
      patterns and replicate them accurately.</p>

    <h3>Kekkai Exam</h3>
    <p>Lastly, the Kekkai Exam requires players to guess the correct combination of elements to unlock a kekkai seal.
      This exam encourages strategic thinking and reinforces the elemental system within the game, making it an exciting
      and engaging challenge for players.</p>
