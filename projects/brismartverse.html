        <p>BRISMARTVERSE is a virtual training platform launched by PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI) through BRI Corporate
          University to train its employees using metaverse technology. The platform features include a Virtual BRI
          Branch, where employees can access a simulated branch office complete with banking areas, management rooms,
          meeting spaces, and back offices. Users can select avatars based on their positions, such as Branch Manager,
          Manager, Supervisor, and Frontliner, to engage in role-playing scenarios with virtual customers who have
          diverse needs. Additionally, the platform offers interactive service modules and virtual meeting capabilities
          that enable collaboration without the constraints of space and time. This application is accessible via VR
          devices like Oculus Quest, as well
          as smartphones and Android tablets. Check the article

      <p>In developing BRISMARTVERSE, BRI collaborated with Shinta VR for the application's creation, and I contributed
        to this project by developing the video streaming feature. This feature allows for video streaming, which is
        divided into two types: scheduled video and local video.</p>
      <div>
        <h3>Scheduled Video</h3>
        <p>Scheduled videos will automatically play according to a predetermined schedule. The video timestamps will be
          synchronized for all users, and users will not have control over the video playback. Scheduled videos can only
          be managed through the web admin. These videos listen for websocket events, allowing them to play immediately
          when a scheduled video event is triggered.</p>

      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Local Video</h3>
        <p>Meanwhile, local videos are videos that users can play when there is no scheduled video currently running.
          These videos are played locally on each userâ€™s device. The list of videos available for users is received via
          a
          web request, and the list can be managed by the admin through the web admin.</p>
