      <h2>VR 2D Texture Draw</h2>
      <p>VR 2D Texture Draw is a system I researched and developed during my time at ShintaVR, designed to enable users
        to write or draw directly within a VR environment. This system facilitates an immersive experience where players
        can interact with objects as if they were drawing or writing on them with a pencil or pen.</p>
      <p>The core functionality of the VR 2D Texture Draw system lies in its ability to detect the tip of a pencil or
        pen as it makes contact with an object. Upon contact, the system captures the coordinates on the object's
        material, allowing it to update the texture dynamically. This approach enables real-time drawing or writing
        directly onto the object's surface, providing a smooth and responsive experience for the user.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the VR 2D Texture Draw system is fully integrated with multiplayer functionality. This
        integration means that any text or drawing created by one player is instantly visible to other players within
        the same VR session. By enabling shared, synchronized interactions, the system enhances collaborative
        experiences in VR, allowing multiple users to draw, write, and visualize updates together in real-time.</p>
