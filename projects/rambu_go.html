      <p>RambuGo! is an educational simulation designed to teach players about the fundamentals of road traffic rules
        in a fun and interactive way. Players navigate a four-wheeled vehicle through various traffic situations, with
        the primary goal of learning and understanding basic road safety principles. The game's unique approach
        combines entertainment with education, allowing players to become familiar with traffic signs and regulations
        while engaging in an immersive gameplay experience.
        You can download the game

    <p>RambuGo! was originally developed for two prominent competitions, Gemastik XIII and CoDig 3.0. We are proud to
      have reached the finals in both, showcasing our dedication to creating a meaningful educational tool. The game
      was a collaborative effort involving a team of three, where I took on the role of team leader and
      programmer. My responsibilities included not only coding the game's mechanics but also managing the overall
      project direction, ensuring that our team met deadlines and maintained a consistent vision for the game.</p>

    <p>In terms of gameplay, RambuGo! adopts an arcade-style format where players are challenged to drive as far as
      possible while adhering to traffic rules. Throughout the game, players encounter various road signs and
      situations that require them to respond correctly, promoting awareness of real-world traffic regulations.
      Additionally, players collect coins along their journey, which can be used to purchase new vehicles, adding an
      element of progression and replayability. This mechanic encourages players to perform well, respect traffic
      laws, and strive to improve their high score with each attempt.</p>

      an ideal tool for players of all ages to learn about road safety while having fun. The game's engaging format
      and focus on practical knowledge make it a valuable addition to the educational game genre, and we are thrilled
      to see the positive impact it has had in both competitions.</p>
