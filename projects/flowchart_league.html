    <h2>Flowchart League</h2>
    <div class="project-description-header">
      <img src="../img/projects/flowchart_league/icon.png" class="project-icon">
      <p>Flowchart League is a strategy game where users have full control to design and program the behavior of their
        units using flowchart symbols. Through this mechanism, users can create complex and varied strategies to
        tackle different battle situations. Users can assemble a team composed of various types of units, each with
        unique abilities and roles, to create optimal formations and effective tactics. You can download the game
        <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kucingmaboek.flowchartleague">here</a>.</p>
    </div>
    <p>I developed Flowchart League entirely on my own, from concept to completion. This project was a comprehensive
      undertaking where I handled every aspect of development to ensure a cohesive experience for players. The game
      utilizes Firebase as its backend, enabling smooth data management and secure storage for player progress and
      other in-game data.</p>
    <p>For the audio, I sourced original sound effects from various real-life recordings found online and edited them
      using Audacity to create a unique auditory experience that enhances the gameplay. The game's 3D assets were
      modeled in Blender, and I hand-painted the textures to add a personal, artistic touch that complements the
      game's visual style. Additionally, all 2D designs, such as UI elements and icons, were designed in CorelDRAW to
      maintain consistency across the visual elements. This project allowed me to bring together a variety of skills,
      from backend integration to art and sound design, all while creating an engaging learning tool for players
      interested in programming logic. </p>
    <p>In this game, there are several key features that form part of the core mechanism of this game. These features
      include:</p>
    <h3>Flowchart Editor</h3>
    <p>This feature is used to design the action flow for units in the game. Through a drag-and-drop interface, users
      can compose, save, and organize the action flow of units using flowchart symbols. This feature simplifies the
      process of creating logical flows by providing easy-to-understand visualizations, allowing users to design unit
      logic flows more easily. The flowcharts created will then be converted into Finite State Machine (FSM) models
      and used
      to manage transitions between various states in the game, ensuring that units can transition between states
      dynamically
      according to the specified conditions.</p>

    <h3>Units and Teams</h3>
    <p>Units in this game refer to characters or entities that users can control. Each unit has unique roles and
      abilities and can be programmed to perform various actions in battle according to instructions given by users
      using flowchart symbols. There are various types of units that users can choose from, each with different skills
      and statistics. The FSM manages how each unit transitions between various states, such as attacking, moving, or
      defending, based on the conditions set by the user in the flowchart. For example, the FSM can transition from a
      MoveTo state to a FleeFrom state when detecting an enemy unit of a specific type. This means the unit type can
      be one of the conditions triggering the FSM transition, allowing for more dynamic and responsive strategies in
      the game.</p>

    <h3>Battle Simulation</h3>
    <p>After composing the flowcharts and assembling the team, users can start the battle simulation to test the
      effectiveness of their strategies. In the battle simulation, the user's team will face off against an opposing
      team with varied strategies in each challenge. In the battle simulation, the flowcharts applied to each unit
      will be transformed into FSM models. The FSM has full control over each unit's behavior in battle, managing
      state transitions based on the conditions specified in the flowchart. Users can observe the results of the
      battle simulation to evaluate their strategies, identify strengths and weaknesses, and make adjustments if
      necessary. <br>
      Each challenge can also have unique battle rules. These rules govern various aspects of the battle, such as the
      number of team members, maximum endurance limits, attack power multipliers, and other parameters. With these
      rules, each challenge becomes more diverse and challenging, as users must adapt their strategies to the set
      parameters to achieve victory. This encourages users to develop different strategic approaches depending on the
      battle conditions in each challenge.</p>
