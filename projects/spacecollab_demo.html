    <h2>SpaceCollab Demo</h2>

      <p>SpaceCollab Demo is a demonstration version of the SpaceCollab application, which is an interactive, 3D-based
        virtual meeting platform. The demo serves to showcase the various potentials and capabilities of the full
        SpaceCollab experience, allowing users to explore the features and interactive elements that make virtual
        meetings more engaging and immersive.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Currently, SpaceCollab Demo is available exclusively on the Meta platform, and I was entrusted by my company to
      manage and publish this application on the Meta Store. In this project, my primary contributions were the
      development of the localization system and screen sharing functionality.</p>
    <p>The localization system I implemented allows for effortless language customization, enabling translations to be
      easily created using spreadsheet editors like Microsoft Excel. This approach empowers translators with little to
      no IT background to seamlessly contribute their language skills, simplifying the localization process and making
      the app accessible to a broader audience.</p>

    </div>
    <p>For screen sharing, I integrated the Agora SDK, which facilitates effective sharing of screens during online
      meetings—perfect for scenarios such as business presentations and collaborative discussions. This feature enhances
      the application’s value for virtual meetings by providing real-time visual sharing, which is critical in
      professional settings. Overall, Space Collab Demo offers a glimpse into a versatile and forward-thinking virtual
      meeting solution.</p>
